# My-Interests-Page
This project uses HTML and CSS to create a personal interest webpage.  

I used a nav bar on the left and also a scroll-behavior property to smooth the scrolling through the page. 

This project was based off FreeCodeCamp's third ResponsiveWebDesign project called "Technical Documentation Page".
