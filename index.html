        <header><h1>Introduction</h1></header>
        <p>Hello, my name is Timothy Loveland and I am a 26 year-old (as of Sep. 1, 2022) aspiring software developer. I am currently learning HTML and CSS on FreeCodeCamp and enjoying it so far.  This page is actually my third project.</p>
        <p>Here on this page you will find information about some of my interests.</p>
        <p>I plan to go to the backend development section on FreeCodeCamp. After, I will take a project course on Udemy and head over to The Odin Project and do their JavaScript course. I also plan on learning React after Odin Project.</p>
        <p>I hope you get something out of this page. Thanks for reading!</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Jesus_Christ">
        <header><h1>Jesus Christ</h1></header>
        <p>I wanted to put Jesus at the top of this list because without Him, I would not be alive or the person I am today. He has changed my life by saving me from my sins and helping me love people.</p>
        <p>I love how Jesus helped a lot of people by healing the sick, casting out demons, raising people from the dead, making the lame walk, and recovering the sight of the blind. He was a very compassionate person.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite things that Jesus did was calming the storm when Him and the disciples were out at sea. They responded, "who is this that even the winds and waves obey Him?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-27.htm" target="_blank">Matthew 8:27</a>).</p>
        <p>I also love how God helped His people in the Old Testament.  I love the stories of Abraham, Joseph, the judges, and David.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Drumming">
        <header><h1>Drumming</h1></header>
        <p>Drumming is my main hobby and one of my favorite activities to do since I was 8 years-old. I've been playing on and off since then and had the opportunity to play in a rock band in high school and for church currently.</p>
        <p>My favorite type of music to play on drums is rock. I grew up playing to bands like Fall Out Boy, Paramore, and Modest Mouse. In middle and early high school I started liking metal music and learned it on drums. My music taste has changed tremendously since then.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite drummers include Kelly Bilan, Danny Carey, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzeM31yzReU" target="_blank">Eric Moore</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zLuP_ybTiA" target="_blank">Aaron Gillespie</a>.  Aaron's band Underoath is one of my all time favorite bands.</p>
        <p>My drumkit is as follows:</p>
        <ul id="list-two">
          <li>2001 Pearl White DW Collector's series</li>
          <li>Remo drumheads</li>

      <section class="main-section" id="Storms">
        <header><h1>Storms</h1></header>
        <p>I am fascinated by storms, specifically hurricanes. Growing up in South Florida, we have our fair share of storms.  I love the tropical weather and feeling the power of the wind during strong storms.</p>
        <p>I have lived through 3 direct landfalls of hurricanes. In 2004, Frances and Jeanne hit Stuart, Florida as catergory 2 and 3 hurricanes, respectively. In 2005, hurricane Wilma moved over Stuart as a category 2.</p>
        <p>In 2019, we almost got hit by hurricane Dorian, but its eye stayed off the coast over the Bahamas. We got tropical storm conditions when Dorian was off the coast and it was cool to be in the wind at the beach.</p>
        <p>Here are some links to each hurricane I mentioned:</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Special_Forces">
        <header><h1>Special Forces</h1></header>
        <p>When I was a kid, I was also fascinated with Navy SEALs and wanted to be one in high school. I have an affinity for men in the special forces, and the military in general. I think it's awesome that they partake in some of the hardest missions in the world.</p>
        <p>It says in Psalms 82:4 to "Rescue the weak and needy. Free them from the hand of the wicked." Therefore, I admire men and women who use their skills to protect other people.</p>
        <p>I'm currently reading a book named Fearless by Eric Blehm.  It is about a man who came from a rough past, was saved by Jesus, and then became a DEVGRU (SEAL team 6) SEAL.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="World_History">
        <header><h1>World History</h1></header>
        <p>One of my favorite topics in school was world history.  I specifically am fascinated with the ancient Middle-East, ancient Greece, and the Middle Ages.</p>
        <p>I like the stories of the Trojan war, the minotaur at Crete, and Greek mythology. It would be awesome to visit Greece one day.</p>
        <p>Also, I love stories like Beowulf and how the germanic tribes settled throughout Europe. The vikings were one of my favorite topics in middle school.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Movies">
        <header><h1>Movies</h1></header>
        <p>It's always nice to enjoy a good movie here and there. I love watching adventure films or movies that have a <i>good vs. evil</i> plot. I like the development of the story and watching the characters grow. Watching a movie with friends is a pastime of mine.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite movies are: <i>The Book of Eli</i>, <i>Den of Thieves</i>, <i>The Blind Side</i>, <i>The Avengers</i> series, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, and <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.</p>
        <p>I like going to the movie theatre and seeing a movie with friends.  However, sometimes it's nice to watch a movie at a friend's house.  I used to watch a lot of movies with my friend Ryan.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Surfing/Skating">
        <header><h1>Surfing/Skating</h1></header>
        <p>I enjoy surfing and skateboarding. I'm not super good at either but they're both fun to do when I can. I like surfing with friends and I usually skate by myself. I think I'm equally good at both.</p>
        <p>I started surfing in 2014 when my cousin Robby showed me how to surf.  Riding a wave is so fun and it's awesome to go fast. I need to work on my pop-up once I catch the wave.  I ride long-boards and use my sister's old 8' Roxy singlefin board.</p>
        <p>In 2004, I started to learn how to skateboard. I like cruising and practicing my ollies.  I also really like watching skate videos. It takes a lot of hard work to get good at skateboarding. My old roomates from Jacksonville were pretty good at skating.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Coding">
        <header><h1>Coding</h1></header>
        <p>Finally, coding is a hobby I started to pick up that I eventually want to turn into a career.  I started learning C++ in 2019 and loved it.  I enjoy learning front-end development now and want to eventually learn Python. My goal is to become a front-end developer and later down the line become full-stack.</p>
